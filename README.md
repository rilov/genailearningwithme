Gen AI Learning Hub
Welcome to the Gen AI Learning Hub! This repository is a community-driven resource designed to facilitate learning and exploration of Generative AI technologies using Python. Inside, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics, from beginner to advanced levels, aimed at sharing knowledge and experiences within the learning community.

Our goal is to empower learners by providing hands-on examples and tutorials that demonstrate the capabilities of Generative AI models, and how to implement them effectively. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding of Gen AI, this hub is for you.

Getting Started
To get started with the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the required packages. Here's how you can do it:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website.

Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment
Create a Virtual Environment: Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows, run:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux, run:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Installing Required Packages
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: A requirements.txt file should be present in your repository, listing all the necessary packages. If it's missing, you can create one by listing packages like jupyter, numpy, pandas, etc., depending on what your notebooks require.

Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
If you haven't installed Jupyter Notebook yet, you can do so by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install notebook
To launch Jupyter Notebook, run:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the interface in your default web browser.

Navigate to the notebook file (.ipynb) you wish to run and click on it to open.
